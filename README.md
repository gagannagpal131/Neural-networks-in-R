Implementation of Machine Learning in R using a Neural network 

I've implemented Machine Learning on a data set "sleepStudy" by fitting a neural network on it.I have divided the original dataset into two parts :-test and train.Train dataset is used to train the dataset and the test dataset is used to test the neural network,i.e. perform predictive analysis on the data.A comparison between the actual values and the predicted values is shown.Mean absolute percentage error between the actual and the predicted data is shown which tells us the efficiency of the neural network.

Note:- 1.)To implement this code,the package "neuralnet" needs to be installed first.
       2.)This code is optimised for R version 3.2.4 not Rstudio
